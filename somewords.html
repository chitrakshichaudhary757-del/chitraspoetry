    <h1>SOME WORDS</h1>

    <p>You said it in anger, I know. But that one word — it stayed with me.<br>
    Maybe for you, it was just a reaction. But for me, <br>
    it was something that went straight to my heart and refused to leave.<br>
    You moved on, but I’m still standing in the echo of that.<br>
    I’m not angry anymore — I’m just hurt.</p>

    <p>Because when you know I’m the kind of person who feels everything deeply,<br>
    then why you said something that breaks me from inside?<br>
    I’m not asking for an apology, but atleast I deserve an explanation.<br>
    I just wish you could understand how heavy it still feels.</p>

    <p>I smile and talk like normal,<br>
    but somewhere inside, that one word keeps replaying.<br>
    Maybe someday, I’ll stop hearing that echo inside me.<br>
    But today, it’s still here.<br>
    I hope you’ll understand…</p>
