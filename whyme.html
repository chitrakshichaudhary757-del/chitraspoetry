    <h1>WHY ME?</h1>

    <p>If you want to ask <em>“Why me?”</em><br>
    When you’re feeling really blue,<br>
    When the world has turned against you,<br>
    And you don’t know what to do —</p>

    <p>When the raindrops feel painful,<br>
    And the winds are harsh and wild,<br>
    When you’re lost and confused,<br>
    And words can’t express what’s inside —</p>

    <p>When you feel the sun won’t shine,<br>
    And even the stars lose their glow,<br>
    When life feels heavy,<br>
    And you whisper once more — <em>Why me?</em></p>

    <p>Then I want to ask you something —<br>
    When life feels bright and kind,<br>
    When everything around you is pink and fine,<br>
    When you’re smiling and full of joy,<br>
    When you love being you —</p>

    <p>Do you ask <em>“Why me?”</em> then?<br>
    No?<br>
    If not, and you ask it in your blues,<br>
    Then please, please ask it in your pinks too.</p>

    <p>Because life is a coin —<br>
    With two sides: happiness and pain.<br>
    If you embrace one side,<br>
    Learn to smile in the other again.</p>

    <p>And when you accept this coin with your whole heart,<br>
    You’ll find the raindrops softer,<br>
    The winds gentler,<br>
    The sun rising once more,<br>
    The stars shining brighter —<br>
    And life, my dear,<br>
    You’ll finally live it —<br>
    Without ever asking <em>“Why me?”</em> again.</p>
