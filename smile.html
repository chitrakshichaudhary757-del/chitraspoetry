    <h1>SMILE</h1>

    <p>It’s your smile that captured my heart,<br>
    Every time I look at it, I feel we’ll never be apart.<br>
    The way your eyes light up, sparkling with joy,<br>
    Makes me feel like I’m your favorite — the one you enjoy.</p>

    <p>I know, in that moment, you’re someone special,<br>
    Someone I want to hold and cherish forever.<br>
    Your smile is like a ray of sunshine on a rainy day,<br>
    It brightens me up in every single way.</p>

    <p>It has the power to melt away all my worries,<br>
    And replace them with feelings of love and flurries.<br>
    Every time I see you, my heart skips a beat —<br>
    It’s like a melody, sweet and complete.</p>

    <p>I know that I want to see it for the rest of my life.<br>
    You are my joy, my light —<br>
    And I’ll cherish your smile for all my life.</p>
