    <h1>WHY I WRITE</h1>

    <p>I write when my heart gets too heavy to hold,<br>
    I write about my scars — both new and old.<br>
    When memories leave me in smiles and tears,<br>
    When some words haunt me and whisper my fears.</p>

    <p>I write when I have a lot to share,<br>
    But don’t know how to express, and don’t wish to bare.<br>
    I write when I feel as lonely as one can be,<br>
    When silence speaks louder than any plea.</p>

    <p>Not when tears, but when smiles disguise the pain,<br>
    I write to wash my soul in the rain.<br>
    When my lips tremble with a weary smile,<br>
    And my eyes, hiding the stories awhile.</p>

    <p>I write to free the weight inside me,<br>
    To heal, to breathe, to simply be.<br>
    So ink becomes my secret friend,<br>
    And words — the wings on which I fly.</p>
