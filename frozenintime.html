    <h1>FROZEN IN TIME</h1>

    <p>As the roses lose their hue,<br>
    These petals get dry, but holds a clue.<br>
    Still it kept their faded beauty inside,<br>
    A love that blooms through the time flies.</p>

    <p>Its wither petals holds a tale,<br>
    With the colors so vibrant, like a magic on nature’s scale.<br>
    A rose may fade and lose its bloom,<br>
    But it always dispells all the gloom.</p>

    <p>Well, a fresh rose is always loved<br>
    For the fragrance of divine.<br>
    But the dried one — for the memories<br>
    Those are frozen in the time.</p>

    <p>~ Chitra</p>
